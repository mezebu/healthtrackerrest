# Health Tracker REST

This project is a RESTful API designed to manage health-related information, including user details, activities, fitness goals, and associated images. It utilizes Javalin, a lightweight web framework for Kotlin.

## Features

- **User Management**: CRUD operations for users, including retrieval by ID or email, addition, deletion, and updating user details.
- **Activity Tracking**: Functions to handle activities, such as retrieving all activities, adding, deleting, or updating individual activities.
- **Fitness Goals**: Management of fitness goals, enabling users to create, delete, update, and retrieve fitness goals.
- **Image Information**: Handling images associated with health tracking, with support for adding, deleting, updating, and retrieving image details.

## Configuration

### Database Configuration

The application connects to a PostgreSQL database. Modify the `DbConfig` class in `ie.setu.config` to set your database credentials:

```kotlin
// Modify these variables with your PostgreSQL database details
val pgHOST = "flora.db.elephantsql.com"
val pgPORT = "5432"
val pgUSER = "your_username"
val pgPASSWORD = "your_password"
val pgDATABASE = "your_database_name"
```

### Javalin Configuration

The `JavalinConfig` class in `ie.setu.config` handles the setup of the Javalin web server. The port can be configured through the environment variable `PORT` or defaults to port 7000 if not set.

- `/users/{user-id}/goals`: User goal overview
- `/activities`: Activity overview
- `/activities/{activity-id}`: Activity profile
- `/goals`: Goal overview
- `/goals/{goal-id}`: Goal profile

### Additional Controllers

#### ActivityController

The `ActivityController` manages operations related to activities:

- `getAllActivities`: Retrieve all activities.
- `getActivitiesByUserId`: Get activities by user ID.
- `getActivitiesByActivityId`: Get activity by activity ID.
- `addActivity`: Add a new activity.
- `deleteActivityByActivityId`: Delete activity by activity ID.
- `deleteActivityByUserId`: Delete activities by user ID.
- `updateActivity`: Update activity details.

#### FitnessGoalController

The `FitnessGoalController` handles operations associated with fitness goals:

- `getAllFitnessGoals`: Retrieve all fitness goals.
- `getFitnessGoalsByUserId`: Get fitness goals by user ID.
- `getFitnessGoalsByFitnessGoalId`: Get fitness goals by fitness goal ID.
- `addFitnessGoal`: Add a new fitness goal.
- `deleteFitnessGoalByFitnessGoalId`: Delete fitness goal by fitness goal ID.
- `deleteFitnessGoalByUserId`: Delete fitness goals by user ID.
- `updateFitnessGoal`: Update fitness goal details.

### Database Structure

The application uses the following database tables:

#### Users

- `id`: User ID (Auto-incremented primary key)
- `name`: User's name
- `email`: User's email

#### Activities

- `id`: Activity ID (Auto-incremented primary key)
- `description`: Description of the activity
- `duration`: Duration of the activity
- `calories`: Calories burned
- `started`: Timestamp of when the activity started
- `userId`: References `Users.id` (On delete, cascade)

#### FitnessGoals

- `id`: Fitness goal ID (Auto-incremented primary key)
- `goalType`: Type of fitness goal
- `target`: Target for the goal
- `initialUserStatus`: Initial user status for the goal
- `duration`: Duration of the goal
- `startDate`: Start date of the goal
- `endDate`: End date of the goal
- `userId`: References `Users.id` (On delete, cascade)

### Data Access Objects (DAO)

#### ActivityDAO

The `ActivityDAO` class in `ie.setu.domain.repository` handles database operations related to activities:

```kotlin
package ie.setu.domain.repository

class ActivityDAO {
    // ... (methods for fetching, adding, updating, and deleting activities)
}
```

#### FitnessGoalDAO

The `FitnessGoalDAO` class in `ie.setu.domain.repository` manages database interactions concerning fitness goals:

```kotlin
package ie.setu.domain.repository

class FitnessGoalDAO {
    // ... (methods for fetching, adding, updating, and deleting fitness goals)
}
```

#### UserDAO

The `UserDAO` class in `ie.setu.domain.repository` is responsible for handling user-related database operations:

```kotlin
package ie.setu.domain.repository

class UserDAO {
    // ... (methods for fetching, adding, updating, and deleting users)
}
```

## Conclusion

The Health Tracker REST project offers a robust RESTful API for managing health-related data, including user details, activities, fitness goals, and image information. Leveraging Javalin, a lightweight web framework for Kotlin, this API provides a streamlined approach to interact with and manage health-related information.

### Key Features
